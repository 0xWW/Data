To run the Llama 3 model for entity resolution in a **Jupyter Notebook**, I'll walk you through the steps required to set up the environment, prepare the data, run the Llama 3 model locally, and process the results.

### Steps to Implement Llama 3 for Entity Resolution in Jupyter Notebook

---

### 1. **Install Necessary Libraries**

To start, ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You’ll need `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `sentencepiece` to work with the Llama model. If you don’t have them installed, you can do so by running the following:

```bash
!pip install transformers accelerate sentencepiece pandas psycopg2
```

---

### 2. **Load and Preprocess Data**

Here’s how you can load the data from your PostgreSQL tables and Neptune relationships. I’ll assume you have access to PostgreSQL data, so let’s fetch that first.

#### a. **Fetching Entity Data from PostgreSQL:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2

# Connect to PostgreSQL and fetch entity data
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="your_postgres_host",
    database="your_database_name",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)

# Load data from PostgreSQL tables
legal_entity_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM legal_entity", conn)
address_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM address", conn)
phone_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM phone", conn)
email_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM email", conn)

# Close connection after fetching the data
conn.close()

# Preprocess: Combining data to a single dataset for feeding into the model
entity_data = legal_entity_df.merge(address_df, on="entity_id", how="left")
entity_data = entity_data.merge(phone_df, on="entity_id", how="left")
entity_data = entity_data.merge(email_df, on="entity_id", how="left")

# Display first few rows to verify
entity_data.head()
```

This will fetch and combine all relevant entity data from PostgreSQL. Now you have the dataset ready for entity resolution.

### 3. **Setting Up Llama 3 in Jupyter Notebook**

To use Llama 3 in a Jupyter environment, you can load the model using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.

#### a. **Loading Llama 3 Model and Tokenizer:**

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

# Load the Llama 3 model and tokenizer
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3b")
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3b")
```

Make sure you have access to the model weights, which you can get from Hugging Face. The model name here (`meta-llama/Llama-3b`) can be adjusted based on the model version you’re using (you can use 3B, 7B, or others).

---

### 4. **Preparing Prompts for Llama 3**

Now, we need to create prompts that we’ll pass into Llama 3. These prompts will describe the entity pairs for comparison and ask the model to determine whether they are duplicates or distinct entities.

#### a. **Generating Prompts for Entity Resolution:**

```python
def create_entity_prompt(row1, row2):
    # Create a natural language prompt to feed to Llama 3
    prompt = f"""
    We have two entities, and we need to decide if they are duplicates or different entities.

    Entity 1:
    Name: {row1['name']}
    Address: {row1['address']}
    Phone: {row1['phone']}
    Email: {row1['email']}

    Entity 2:
    Name: {row2['name']}
    Address: {row2['address']}
    Phone: {row2['phone']}
    Email: {row2['email']}

    Please analyze these entities and suggest whether they are the same or different, and explain why.
    """
    return prompt

# Example usage with the first two rows from entity_data
row1 = entity_data.iloc[0]  # Replace with actual row
row2 = entity_data.iloc[1]  # Replace with actual row

# Generate the prompt
prompt = create_entity_prompt(row1, row2)
print(prompt)
```

This function generates a prompt for each pair of entities, which will then be passed into the Llama 3 model for comparison.

---

### 5. **Using Llama 3 for Entity Resolution**

Now that you have the prompt, you can pass it into the Llama 3 model to get the entity resolution output.

#### a. **Generating Output Using Llama 3:**

```python
def resolve_entities_with_llama(prompt):
    # Tokenize the input prompt
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate output from the Llama model
    output = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=300)

    # Decode and return the model's response
    return tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Run the entity resolution on the generated prompt
result = resolve_entities_with_llama(prompt)
print("Llama 3 Resolution Result:", result)
```

This function tokenizes the prompt, feeds it into the Llama 3 model, and generates the output, which is the model’s suggestion on whether the entities are duplicates or not.

---

### 6. **Comparing Entity Pairs in Batch Mode**

If you have many entities to compare, you can loop through your dataset, creating prompts for multiple entity pairs and passing them into the Llama 3 model for resolution.

#### a. **Batch Processing of Entity Pairs:**

```python
# Compare each entity in the dataset with another entity
for i in range(len(entity_data)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(entity_data)):
        row1 = entity_data.iloc[i]
        row2 = entity_data.iloc[j]

        # Create prompt for the entity pair
        prompt = create_entity_prompt(row1, row2)
        
        # Get Llama's resolution
        result = resolve_entities_with_llama(prompt)
        print(f"Comparison between {row1['name']} and {row2['name']}:\n", result)
```

This will loop through the dataset, compare each entity pair, and output the resolution suggested by Llama 3.

---

### 7. **(Optional) Fine-Tuning Llama 3 on Your Data**

If you want more accuracy, you can fine-tune the Llama 3 model on your specific entity resolution data. You’ll need labeled entity pairs (duplicate or distinct) to train the model.

However, fine-tuning Llama 3 requires a more advanced setup with GPUs, and you can refer to Hugging Face’s documentation for further details: [Fine-tuning Llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llama).

---

### 8. **Continuously Improving the Model with Feedback**

As you collect feedback on which entities are duplicates or distinct, you can refine your model’s accuracy by retraining it or adjusting the prompts to better suit the data.

### Final Steps:
- **Data Ingestion**: Retrieve and merge entity data.
- **Llama 3 Setup**: Install and load the Llama 3 model in your Jupyter Notebook.
- **Prompt Generation**: Create natural language prompts to feed into the model.
- **Entity Resolution**: Use the Llama model to resolve entity comparisons.
- **Batch Processing**: Loop through entity pairs for large-scale resolution tasks.

This notebook will help you perform **Entity Resolution** using Llama 3 directly within a Jupyter environment, and you can enhance the performance by fine-tuning the model based on feedback from manual reviews.
